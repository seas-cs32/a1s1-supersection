    "\n",
    "Today we learn to write our first script. Recall that our goal is to get the machine to act in a certain way, to perform a specific computation that we desire. The purpose of a script is to articulate the sequence of steps that will, when executed, cause the machine to perform the actions we desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be run, scripts must eventually be written in a programming language. Computer programming languages are not as flexible and forgiving (or ambiguous, depending on your point of view) as human languages. Each programming language defines its own specific syntax for the collection of general concepts that set the foundation for programming in most all programming languages. You should know that it is easy to get bogged down in the minutiae of these syntactic details. Python, while better than many, still has its own share of such nit-picky details.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start to write your own scripts, I don't want you to start by worrying about how you say something with precise Python syntax. Why? Because you are just starting to communicate in this new language, and as a child begins to talk, most parents do not correct their every grammatical mistake. Instead, parents encourage the child's broken English (or whatever your native tongue is). The goal is to encourage them to *put words to their ideas*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we start to program, we have the same goal. Broken English for us is what computer scientists call *pseudocode*. In pseudocode, it is fair game to write down the step you'd like the computer to take at this point in your script in any English phrase that makes sense to you. If you want the computer to open a window on the screen, you can type \"open a window on the screen\". If you want the computer to add 5 to 6, you can type \"add 5 + 6\". I don't care what you write as long as you --- and hopefully others --- have a strong sense of what you mean. Every time I will write some new code in class, I'll try to start with some my own pseudocode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have written a nice chunk of pseudocode (i.e., some code that does something interesting), we can then translate that pseudocode into actual Python code and try to run it on our machine. I encourage you to not short-circuit these two steps and start writing in Python until you find yourself thinking in Python. Even after decades of programming, I still sketch out some pseudocode (and often draw pictures) before I try to write any actual lines of code in any of the programming languages I know.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Define the problem to be solved.** Okay, let's start writing some code to solve a problem. We have been talking about children learning to read and speak, and this brought to mind one of my favorite children's book, *The Cat in the Hat* by Dr. Seuss. I just happen to have a plain text file here with the beginning of the book. Let's see if we can get the computer to read it to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Consider your inputs.** Once you've defined a problem to be solved, you should next consider the types of inputs you'll provide to the script you write. At this early stage in the design process, you don't have to consider the full range of inputs, but you should at least review (or list) some example inputs. For our current problem, let's take a quick look at this plain text file I just mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the file contains only the text of *The Cat in the Hat*. It doesn't include any of the whimsical pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Choose your IDE.** I want to write some pseudocode, but where am I going to do it? There are numerous applications that help us to write, run, and debug our code. These tools are typically called an *editor*, an *interpreter* (or *compiler*), and a *debugger*. While you can use three standalone tools, many programmers like to use what is called an *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*. An IDE packages together all the tools you'll need in a single application. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll often use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code IDE in class. You may choose to use this tool. It's free. You may find that it has a steep learning curve, but don't let yourself be overwhelmed with its many features. I use only a small slice of its functionality myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do have other choices, especially as we get started. The \"Tools and Environments\" page on our Canvas course site talks about the concept of editors and interpreters in more detail, and it tells you about a range of choices and the tradeoffs in those choices. Different choices give you different advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this book begins, I encourage you to follow along and write your own version of the script we'll build together in a browser-based IDE called *Replit*. You can access it by opening your favorite browser and typing [replit.com](http://replit.com) in the address bar. When the page appears, go ahead and sign up (unless you already did this in class) and then log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The narrative in this first chapter is built on Replit and its interface as of October 2021. One of the most appealing features of Replit is that you can get coding without having to struggle with the complexities of creating a Python development environment on your own personal machine. This is a task that we'll take on later, but let's get started with the fun parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may, however, have some familiarity and experience with another IDE. If so, please feel free to try Replit or follow along in the environment you already know as we develop our very first Python script together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I should mention this book is available as an Interactive Python Notebook (`.ipynb`). If you load this first chapter into Google Colab, for example, you can run most of the code blocks. Code blocks that DO NOT start with a comment of the form \"`### Informative message`\" are code blocks associated with the script we're building together. You can always run them. On the other hand, code blocks that DO start with a `###` comment may or may not be runnable. Those that are runnable often encourage you to try a piece of Python code as a learning exercise. The rest exist for other pedagogical purposes and are marked as \"`### NOT a script and therefore NOT executable`\". Please be alert to these informative messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Replit and Google Colab allow us to write, run, and debug Python code. They differ in that Replit's approach assumes you're writing scripts to be then fed to the Python interpreter while Google Colab's approach foregrounds the interactive Python interpreter. If you don't understand what this means, that's ok. You will very shortly. Just remember this difference if you're reading this text and using Google Colab instead of Replit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Getting started with Replit.** Using the Replit IDE, let's start building our first Python script together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the \"Create Repl\" button; you may have to click the sidebar button to see it. In the resulting dialog box, choose a Python template, change the title to \"seuss\", and click \"Create Repl\" button at the bottom of the dialog box. \n",
    "\n",
    "What results is a window segmented into three pieces. On the left is a file browser, in the middle is the editor where we will write our scripts, and on the right is where we'll see the results of running our scripts. Right now, we have one file `main.py`, which is selected and displayed as empty. The `.py` extension tells the system that it will find (eventually!) Python code in this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to start solving our problem of getting the computer to read a book to us!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Pseudocode and comments.** In the center panel, write a piece of pseudocode that says:"

    "We just wrote in English what we want our script to do. This explanation begins with a character (`#`) that holds special meaning in Python. When the Python interpreter sees it, it tells the interpreter to ignore everything from the hash mark to the end of the line. This is like a note to ourselves or to anyone reading our script. It's not a part of the script that we want the computer to interpret or act out. Programmers refer to things like this as *comments*. While this is only one of several ways to write comments in Python, this is sufficient for us right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are comments good for? According to Swaroop in [*A Byte of Python*](https://python.swaroopch.com/), \"Code tells you how, comments should tell you why.\" And that's generally true, but we're not commenting a completed piece of code. We are simply using this commenting capability to sketch out what we want our script to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Commands and input parameters.** Normally, we would write more pseudocode to sketch out what we want the computer to do for us, but let's convert this pseudocode into Python code so that we can start to get a feel for what it is like to command the computer to do things for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a physical book, the first thing we would do to begin reading it would be to open it up. Let's write `open('CatInTheHat.txt')` below the comment line. This happens to be a valid line of Python code. It tells the Python interpreter to do something. What does it tell the Python interpreter to do? To open the file named `CatInTheHat.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the syntax here for a moment. The form of this statement to the Python interpreter is: *command*(*input parameters*). In the case of an `open` command, the input parameter tells the system what we want opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is this command `open`? It is something that the Python interpreter knows how to do because: (1) it is built into the Python language; (2) it was added to the language by some other person; or (3) we added it to the language ourselves! In the case of `open`, it is a built-in function. We will talk about this more later, but for now, that's all you need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now what? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Scripts versus execution.** Well, so far we've only written some things in a script. It's like a playwright writing words on a page. What's the equivalent in programming of a playwright handing the script to some actors so that they can perform the script (i.e., so that the computer can execute our script)? In this IDE, the big green button at the top of our window labeled \"Run\" is a big hint. This button tells the IDE to take our script and run the entire thing.\n",

    "Oops, we got a whole lot of red text in the rightmost panel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8: Our first error.** No worries. The Python interpreter is simply trying to tell us that it couldn't understand our script in some way. If it helps, think about the interpreter as an actor whose English isn't too great. What can we learn from the broken English in this error message?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yup, `FileNotFoundError` is a great clue, and the file that the interpreter couldn't find was our `CatInTheHat.txt` file. In addition, we can learn that it had this trouble when it tried to execute our `open` command on line 2 of our script.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense because there is nothing but our `main.py` file in our file view panel. How can we change this? Well, we could click the \"Add File\" button in the file view panel, but then we'd have to type in our text file. I'd rather not type in something that already exists. So where can I find it? It's in the `txts` directory inside the `a1s1` (which stands for Act I, Scene I) directory under \"Files\" on the course's Canvas site. Great, if we click the three vertical dots at the top of the \"Files\" panel on Replit, we see that we can \"Upload File\". So, let's download the `CatInTheHat.txt` file from Canvas (to our machines using the three vertical dots next to the file on Canvas) and then upload it to our individual Replit sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that done, let's click the green Run button again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success! I mean, at least no error this time. But also nothing appeared to happen. The right panel in Replit simply displayed a blank line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9: The interactive interpreter.** The rightmost panel in Replit isn't just a place where we see the results of the execution of our script, but it is also where we can feed pieces of Python code directly to the *interactive* Python interpreter. It's like asking the actor to read one line of your script so that you can see how it sounds, or in our case, what the line causes the interpreter to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's feed the two lines of our script to the interactive Python interpreter one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we feed our comment line to the interactive interpreter, what happens? Nothing! Exactly what the interpreter should have done with a comment line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now type our `open` line in the rightmost panel. What happened this time? Something interesting. It's not red-colored text, and so it is not an error. The interpreter is trying to tell us something different. In technical jargon, the interactive Python interpreter prints for us the value computed by the statement it executed. To understand what this means, let's try something simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 10: The interactive interpreter as a calculator.** What happens if I write `2 + 3` as the input to this interactive Python interpreter? Before I hit return, take a moment and think about what I'm asking the interpreter to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool, we can use the interpreter like an infix calculator. It takes an arithmetic expression, and it prints what it calculates. More generally, the interpreter will print for us the value it computes, if any, for each statement we ask it to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a bit of time and play with the interpreter as a calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so we have validated that the interactive Python interpreter prints the value of any statement we ask it to evaluate. So, what is this value that it printed when we asked it to open a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 11: Python help.** Wouldn't it be nice to ask for some help? Yes, it would. So let's do it! Type `help(open)` in the interactive interpreter and execute it."

These other parameters, however, are optional parameters, which are given default values if you do not specify them. That's what the `=` syntax means.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's look only at `mode` and `encoding`. `mode` defaults to `r`, which means that we are going to read the file. Alternatively, we might want to write the file. `encoding` is something we will talk about in greater detail later, but for now you can consider it as telling the interpreter in what language the file is written (e.g., a computer equivalent of asking if a sentence is written in English or French).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we notice that the explanation starts by telling us that this built-in function opens a file and returns a stream. Again, we will talk about file I/O in greater detail later in the semester, but think about it. When I open a book, I probably open the cover and put my finger on the first word on the first page. You can think of a stream as my virtual finger telling me where I'll read the next characters in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to what was printed, the system is telling me about its virtual finger on the page. Roughly, I have something that does I/O on a text file whose name is `CatInTheHat.txt`. The file is open for reading, and the interpreter assumes that the content of the file is encoded in this UTF-8 language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 12: Revisiting our first error.** What happens if we ask the interactive Python interpreter to open a file that doesn't exist? We saw that this caused an error when we executed our whole script and the text file we wanted wasn't in the list of files. Will this error message look different when the problem occurs in the interactive interpreter? I don't know. Ok, I do, but let's pretend I don't.\n",

    "Let's misspell the file name and execute that `open` statement. Type and execute `open('CatInTheHut.txt')` in the interactive interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We got a red error message again, as expected. This time it shouldn't look as scary, as we're already familiar with it. Yup, `FileNotFoundError` as we might have expect to occur again. This is a type of `OSError` that `help` told us would be raised upon failure to successfully complete the `open` operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference this time is that the `Traceback` looks a bit different. It doesn't tell us where in our script the execution error occurred, but that there was a failure on line 1 of this cryptic file \"`<stdin>`\". We don't really need to understand this broken English, since this traceback information is only really needed when we have an error buried somewhere in a multi-line script. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 13: Undefined names.** Ok, let's get back to our script in the middle panel and what we were supposed to be doing. After `open`, the interpreter is sitting waiting for us to tell it what we want it to do with the open file (our virtual open book).\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, how about we read the first line? If Python has a builtin file read command, maybe it has another built-in function called `readline`. Let's type `readline()` on line 3 of the `main.py` script and run the entire script again."

We expect our actors to jump in and out of character while we run these tests on pieces of the script.\n",

Extending this description to our computer environment, running the entire Python script by clicking the green Run button in Replit tells the Python interpreter that this is its showtime. The showtime run of our entire Python script printed nothing in the rightmost execution panel because we didn't tell the Python interpreter to print anything. In particular, the last statement we told the interpreter to execute was to read a line from our file. And that's all it did. If we want the interpreter to print the line it read, we must tell it explicitly to do this. It's like the difference between asking a human actor to read a line in a book while onstage versus reading a line in a book and saying it out loud.\n",

The argument to the `print` command is what we want to print, which in our case is that thing the interpreter read in `readline`. I guess we had better name it so that we can refer to it in our `print` command. Let's call it `the_line`. The following is what our script looks like after these additions."
