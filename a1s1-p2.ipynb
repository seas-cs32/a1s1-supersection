    "**Step 1: Adding robustness.** Adding this `close` statement doesn't add a new feature to our script.  Its purpose is to keep our execution environment clean, and because it doesn't add any noticeable functionality to our script, it is often hard to remember to include a `close` command for every included `open` command. When I first started programming, I often forget this pairing, and now I use a story from my childhood to help me remember.\n",

    "When I was a small boy, my parents would constantly remind me to close the screen door to our home while I came into the house. Why did they do that? Yes! They wanted me to keep the bugs out of the house. We won't go, at this time, into the details of the bugs/errors that can occur if you don't close a file when you're done with it, but suffice it to say if you ever open a file, you should close it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's perfectly fine to do this at the end of your script, as I've done here. If it's not clear, the interpreter stops executing your script when it reaches the script's end. Putting this `close` command right before the end of the script ensures that closing the file is one of the last things the interpreter does for us before stopping execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Using** `with-as`**.** What if I wanted to close the file earlier in the script? I could do that, but if I'm making as many changes to the script as we made last time, I might mistakenly move the `close` to some point before I'm actually done reading the file. For example, let's move the `close` statement into the loop and execute the script again."

Let's try to do something more interesting like turning this story into a theatrical script. You know, a textual format that a couple of actors --- playing the narrator, the Cat, the Fish, Things One and Two, and the Mother --- could perform. In case you've forgotten, but the narrator's sister, Sally, never speaks in this story.\n",

Let's find the dialogue first, since that should be easier given that each piece of dialogue is enclosed in double quotes in this story.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Reuse.** I like to start a project like this by asking myself, \"Can I keep anything from a script I wrote recently?\" Let's look at the last script (`a1s1/seuss2.py`) we executed. What does this script do that I could reuse in my new script, and what in it are statements that I'll no longer need? This little exercise is always a good idea. You'll start much quicker if you jumpstart your new script with code from an old script that already works. Reuse is good, for our environment and in your life as a programmer.\n",

Let's keep the first three (non-comment) statements from `seuss2.py`. We'll also need to know when we've reached the end of the story. Plus, we'll need to eventually close the open file, which `with-as` will do automatically for us! Basically, we just need to delete the line with the `print` and then start adding pseudocode at the end of the `while` loop to solve our new problem.

    "**Step 6: Finite State Machines.** One way to solve the first small piece of our larger problem is to think of your script operating in one of several different states as it accomplishes the task you have set for it. We start our script in some initial (or start) state, which we will call `S0`. We read our input looking for some event that transitions us from this start state to some other state that we will call `S1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2-1 is the beginning of a diagram of a finite state machine (FSM), where the states are represented as labeled circles (also called *nodes*) and *transitions* as directed arrows from one state to another. Each transition is annotated with the event that cause the transition. The start state is identified by the special transition labeled `Start`.\n",

    "Before we continue, let's make this concrete for the problem in front of us. We want to find each line of dialogue in our input file, and we know that the dialogue in this story is surrounded by double quotes. When our script begins, it starts in a state `S0`, which for our processing problem indicates that we have yet to see a double quote. While this is technically true, I find it more helpful to think of this start state as one in which our script is searching for a double quote character. When the script finds a double quote character, this event tells us that we have found the start of a line of dialogue, and the event causes a transition into a new state labeled `S1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is this new state `S1`? Well, the characters we are reading now are characters that we want to remember and later print as dialogue. We could think of `S1` as our script collecting the characters associated with the current line of dialogue. This string of characters ends when the current line of dialogue ends, which is when we see another double quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "In state `S1`, we again are searching for a double quote as the event that exits this state. When the script finds a double quote, this event will cause another state transition as the script moves again to a different kind of processing of the input story. What is the processing we want the script to do in this state following `S1`? Well, when we see the double quote at the end of a line of dialogue, we simply want to switch back to searching for the next piece of dialogue. That action is described by our start state `S0`, and so we can transition from `S1` to `S0` when our script encounters the next double quote (i.e., the one that ends the current line of dialogue).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our script will keep ping ponging back and forth between these two states, happily collecting lines of dialogue, until what happens? Is there any other event to which our FSM should react? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! Eventually, our input story ends (i.e., our script reads EOF, or end of file). In addition to a distinguished start state, FSMs have a set of distinguished end, or goal, states. End states in this depiction of a FSM are nodes with a double circle. Figure 2-2 illustrates our complete FSM for finding dialogue in an input text file.\n",

    "Figure 2-2: A complete FSM diagram for finding dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we have designed what is called a *deterministic finite state machine*. By deterministic, we mean that there is at most a single transition out of a state for each possible event. State `S1` has two transitions out, but they are labeled with different events. There are also nondeterministic FSMs, and these allow a single event to cause multiple transitions out of a state. You'll encounter them if you continue to study computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking deeper (optional).** Both deterministic and nondeterministic FSMs are mathematical models of computation, and they are defined by the quintuple of an input alphabet of events, a set of all states, a start state, a transition function, and a set of (possibly empty) final sets. The start state and final states are included in (i.e., are a subset of) the set of all states. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transition function maps states and input events to states. For example, the transition function `f` for the FSM diagram above would return `S1` when called with `f(S0,'\"')`. Notice that the transition function does not have to be defined for all combinations of input symbols and states. If no transition function is defined for some pair of current state and input event, the implementation of your FSM should probably raise an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, our FSM above does not have a transition from `S1` on encountering EOF. This is because we don't expect our story to end while we are in the middle of a line of dialogue, i.e., while we are searching for the dialogue's ending double-quote character.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just dipped our toes into the deep topic of FSMs. They are a great representation for modeling lots of mechanical, biological, and linguistic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough about the representation, let's see how we can use the diagram we've drawn to help us think about the code we want to write. As I mentioned earlier, pictures can sometimes help us to write the code we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Encoding the state information.** The first thing to note about our picture is that it contains only three states, and the third state (`S2`) represents the termination of our script. This means that our script has only to keep track of which of the first two states (`S0` and `S1`) it is in at any point in time. We can do this with a single Boolean variable. Let's call this variable `looking_for_open_quote`. When it is `True`, it indicates that we are in state `S0` and when it is `False` we are in `S1`. With this decision and our diagram, we can start writing some pseudocode."

    "**Step 9: Strings as a sequence of characters.** To this point, we've been relying on your intuition for what constitutes a string in Python. We created them by defining string literals. We read file lines as a string and compared them against string literals (i.e., to test for EOF). And we printed them out to the terminal. Probably none of this work forced you to think about how we were representing strings in the computer; we simply operated on them as big blobs. However, if we want to ask whether a string contains a particular character, we are going to have to know if Python allows us to ask about the components of a string object. \n",

For example, the objects on my office bookshelf when viewed from left to right could be represented as a Python `list` containing a stuffed animal, and then a picture of my kids, and then this course's textbook, followed by an old CD, and then some other books.\n",

A membership test is exactly what we need to answer the question of whether the string named `the_line` contains a double-quote character! \n",

    "**Step 14: Design patterns for error handling.** When you been programming long enough, like any practiced skill, you'll start to see repeated patterns. This is one for error handling. A command, function, or method carves out one or more values in the range of its return value and distinguishes those values as error conditions. In our current example, `find` needs only the integers in the range `0` to `len(s)-1` to fully accomplish its stated functionality. The person who wrote the implementation of `find` was free to pick any value outside this range of valid return values as an error condition. She might have picked several such values to indicate a number of different error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things you'll learn as your programming skill grows is that you should always check and handle the error conditions that might occur in the commands, functions, and methods you use. The only reason not to do this is because you have carefully reasoned out why the error condition cannot occur (e.g., we might know that `the_line` must contain a double-quote character when the script executes `the_line.find('\"')` because of some processing we did immediately prior to this point in our script that determined that specific fact).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also realize that just because a design pattern is common doesn't mean it isn't without headaches. This pattern results in us adding the statement `if i != -1:` to our script, which we are supposed to read as \"if `find` returned a valid index into `the_line` then we found an opening double-quote character at index `i`.\" Yea, it doesn't look much like that to me either and that's why I stuck in the comment at the start of the body of our inner if-statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not an issue with the structure of the logic in our current script, many programmers also dislike this design pattern because it can break up the flow of your script with lots of point checks for uncommon error conditions. When you are constantly distracted by infrequently true error checks, it can make it very hard for you and others reading your script to understand how the script performs its main function. We can solve this headache by using a different design patter for error handling, which keeps exceptional events out of the main flow of your algorithm. We will talk about this other design pattern soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 15: Never go too long without testing.** Returning to the script we're trying to build, we have a choice of how to proceed. On the one hand, we can continue to write code to handle all the cases that might occur in state `S0` (e.g., the case we've flagged in our \"FIXME!\" comment). Our minds are focused on state `S0`, and it may be enticing to continue working on it until we've handled every case we can imagine. On the other hand, we could switch and start writing some code for state `S1`. In particular, we could write `S1` code that complements the code we just finished in `S0`. The benefit of this approach is that it would allow us to see if we can get our script to run on some subset of the possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice: When you have the opportunity to test what you've written, take it. It's a good practice to build your script in pieces that you can regularly test. I like the feeling of accomplishment when I get another small piece of my larger problem to work. Plus, it is often efficient from an overall time perspective if you don't spend a lot of time coding a design that was doomed to failure based on one of your earliest design decisions. Regular testing will keep you from wasting a lot of time on doomed designs. Finally, this class will encourage you to follow this approach by the way in which we construct our problem sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we need to write for state `S1` that integrates with what we just finished writing for `S0`? When our script is in state `S1`, it is looking for the close quote corresponding to the open quote we saw in state `S0`. This sounds a lot like the work we just finished."

This is equivalent to the statement: `dialog = dialog + the_line[:i+1]`. Let's think about what this expanded statement might mean. The variable to the left of the `+` operator is the part of the current line of dialogue that appeared in previous file lines; the variable to the right of the `+` operator is the final part of the current line of dialogue up to and including the ending double quote. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking deeper (for understanding).** Do you fully understand why the code we just described includes the ending double quote? If not, you may wish to read the documentation about the string method `find` and review how the indices in slicing work. If you left off the `+1` in `the_line[:i+1]`, this would be an example of what's called an off-by-one error. They are quite common in programming, and you should train yourself to be alert to situations where they might occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in state `S1` prints the entire line of dialogue once we've found the closing double quote character. This must mean that `dialog` contains the entire dialogue after the `+` operation in the statement above the `print` statement. Hopefully, you're starting to realize that the `+` operator ,when surrounding by string values, performs a concatenation operation. You can read the Python documentation for strings to see that our reasoning is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can place a `+` operator in your scripts between two integer values, between two string values, and even between some other types of values. Unsurprisingly, the `+` operator surrounded by two integers will simply add those two values and return the sum. The `+` operator when given two string values will concatenate those strings, which is a fundamentally different operation. This is called *overloading*, and we will return to this concept when we dive deeper into abstraction in Act II. Oh, and in both cases, `+=` is simply a shorthand for these operations when the name given to the returned value is the same as the name used by the lefthand operand to the `+` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other interesting new thing in the code for state `S1` is the addition of an `else` clause, which wasn't needed in state `S0`. The body of the `else` executes when `the_line` does not contain a double-quote character. Its execution concatenates the current string named `the_line` to whatever dialogue had been collected from the immediately preceding file lines. This makes sense because our script needs to capture everything between the opening and closing double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last line of the preceding code block exists to remind us that we haven't carefully considered all the cases that may occur when reading lines from a story. We might have, but we have neither tested on a lot of different examples nor carefully thought through the cases we might encounter. But that's ok for now, since we simply want to see if we can get the script to work for the cases we think we have covered!\n",

    "**Step 17: Testing.** Typically, you want to start testing with small inputs that exercise your script in a limited number of ways. This is a great method for incrementally learning what works and then clearly seeing what doesn't. Being methodical may not be your style, but it makes testing and debugging less of a nightmare. \n",

In our script, `the_line` contains the next *two* events when a line of dialogue fits within a single file line, and we cannot blithely consider that we're done with the processing of `the_line` once we've found *a* double-quote character. That's not what our FSM diagram says to do. It says to start processing the input in state `S1` on the character immediately following the opening double quote. It doesn't say to skip over the characters between the opening double quote and the end of `the_line` string and to start processing with the next line of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we did wrong, we can fix this problem in at least two different ways. We could faithfully adhere to our FSM diagram and write some code that enters state `S1` using only whatever remains in `the_line` after an open quote is found in state `S0`, or we could check for short lines of dialogue in state `S0` and skip the transition to `S1` in these cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes one choice is better than the other, but there's probably not much difference in this case. Let's maintain our current loop structure that processes file lines and decide to no longer adhere closely to our (initially helpful) FSM diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this is a choice! The FSM diagram was meant to help us think about the problem. It was not meant to constrain our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 19: Function composition.** Once we have thought through the problem and outlined a sensible solution, implementing it is fairly straightforward."

    "In `seuss6.py`, we protect the transition to state `S1` (within the work in state `S0`) with a conditional branch that makes sure that the rest of the file line (i.e., `dialog[1:]`) does not contain a double-quote character. If it does, we slice out the short line of dialogue, print it, and stay in state `S0` looking for the next open quote (i.e., the body of the new `else` within the work in state `S0`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax on the righthand side of the `=` operator where we set `short_dialog` is a bit intimidating, and let's take a moment and make sure we understand exactly what it does. The key to understanding is to remember that the Python order of computations takes place left to right. With that in mind, we can read `dialog[1:].split('\"')[0]` as saying: Take the object named `dialog` and treat it as a sequence. We want every item in this sequence except the first (i.e., the 0th item), as specified by the slice `[1:]`. Given this new sequence, split it into two subsequences at the sequence item that is a double quote character, as specified by `.split('\"')`. The double-quote character where the split is performed is not included in either of these subsequences. The value returned by the `split` is itself a sequence; it is simply a sequence comprised of the two subsequences computed by the `split`. And finally, we index into these this new sequence to grab the first of these two subsequences (i.e., at index `0`), which is everything in between the opening double quote and the ending double quote! And this explains why the subsequent `print` concatenates opening and closing double-quote characters back onto the line of dialogue as we print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The righthand side of `short_dialog` assignment statement is an example of *function composition*, and we will see it used often in the code we will read. In fact, we saw an earlier example in our `for` loop code (i.e., `range(len(the_line))`). This example looks a lot like function composition in mathematics, where you evaluate the stuff in the innermost pair of parentheses first and then work your way out to the outermost parentheses. Overall, try not to let either of these different forms of function composition overwhelm or intimidate you. When you come across them, just take them a step at a time. You'll eventually come to appreciate that"

    "Function composition removes the need to give names to the intermediate results, and without names, our attention is not drawn to this work, which necessary for the computation but not really important to the big picture. For human readers, your script should be like a good story. It describes the main action without getting bogged down in unnecessary details of how exactly the characters interact and get from place to place. Unlike a story, your script does contain the details, which a computer needs to know, since it does only what it is exactly told to do. Humans, unlike computers, are distracted by these details. \n",

    "Recall our earlier example of this helpful use of abstraction. We replaced a for-loop and its associated code with an invocation of the `find` method on a string. Both computed a similar result, but we preferred the `find` string method over the for-loop implementation because it was both more concise and more expressive of what this step in our script was doing. In the next act, we will see how we can create our own compact representations so that each line of our script more closely resembles each step in the pseudocode we are trying to implement.\n",

    "**Step 20: There is no character.** Before we go, I want to correct something you may have come to believe. While I have used the term \"character\" to describe single items in the sequence known as a Python string, you should know that there is no distinguished thing that is a character in Python. What we think of as a character is, in Python, just a Python string of length 1. In other words, when I earlier wrote that `print(the_line[0])` returns `'A'`, I was careful to write the result as a Python string. Go ahead and see what `type(the_line[0])` tells you about the type of the object returned from the string index method. We will talk more about types when we reach Act II."
